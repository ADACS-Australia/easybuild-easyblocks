The script here is intended to be used by the ConfigureMake generic easyblock. It is an update for `config.guess` used
by `Autotools` which is frequently not up to date in package releases.

You can obtain the newest version of `config.guess` from the 'config' project at
http://savannah.gnu.org/ . The command to fetch it is
```
$ wget -O config.guess 'http://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=config.git;a=blob_plain;f=config.guess;hb=HEAD'
```

### Conforming to the config.guess licence ###

`config.guess` is GPLv3 while EasyBuild is GPLv2, while these are non-compatible licences `config.guess` is a 

> special exception to the GNU General Public License, if you distribute this file as part of a program that contains a
> configuration script generated by Autoconf, you may include it under the same distribution terms that you use for the
> rest of that program.

In order to conform with this licence exception (and the original intent since we use this file to update software that
uses `Autoconf`) we include a simple `Autoconf`-generated `configure` script here.
